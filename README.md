ML Algorithms

For the Written Assignment, you are tasked to:
Study and explore the Voting vs Stacking ensemble methods. You should study and find out:
a. Comparison between the Voting and Stacking methods.
b. Some technical details on how the algorithms work.
c. Advantages and benefits of the ensemble methods over single classifier/regressor.
d. Any other facts and figures about Voting and Stacking methods that you find interesting and worth sharing.

For the Practical Assignment, you are to demonstrate the application of the Voting and Stacking methods:
a. Select a suitable toy dataset provided by Scikit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html). You may choose to work on a 
   classification or regression problem.
b. Apply the Voting and Stacking methods on the dataset using Scikit-Learn.
c. Compare the performance between the Voting and Stacking ensembles, as well as the performance of the ensembles and their respective base estimators.
d. You should use four to five machine learning models that you would have learned in the course, such as linear regression, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, 
   Na√Øve Bayes, decision trees/random forests and SVM, as base estimators, and logistic regression or gradient boosted trees as the meta learner (for stacking).
